# CyberPunk-Name-Generator

This is a plain HTML, CSS and JS project. The design is not in a great shape but it is totally functional.

JS file has mainly DOM elements and methods in it. It is a single page app (spa) with a changeable input field so JS is mostly based on Node and Child methods.

I don't know very much about CyberPunk that much so the nickname array is a bit short but you can add anything you want and make it richer.
